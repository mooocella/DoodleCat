# DoodleCat
I created a pygame that is based on doodle jump.
 Aside from the basic game features that make it playable. For example, random and moving platforms, collision detection, etc. Some special features include a Score and High Score Counter, a background that changes colours every 10 levels, a game over screen, and the ability to play the game again, given the player presses the space button. 
 I attempted to add little fish and when the player 'collects' them, it gives them the ability to super jump. However, I have not been able to do so before the deadline. I will continue to work on it.
